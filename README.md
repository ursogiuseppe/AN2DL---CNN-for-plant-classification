# AN2DL-CNN-for-plant-classification

* This is the first homework for the Artificial Neural Networks and Deep Learning course, Politecnico di Milano, academic year 2022-2023, prof. Matteucci Matteo.

* The goal of the project is to classify plant images among 8 classes, through a deep convolutional neural network. Therefore, being a classification problem, given an input image (size 96x96), the CNN outputs the predicted class label.

* The notebook is supposed to be run in a Kaggle environment.

* More details about the homework specification and approach to it in the [report](https://github.com/ursogiuseppe/AN2DL-CNN-for-plant-classification/blob/main/GLM22_Report.pdf).

* The project was developed in a team, composed by me, Lorenzo Trevisan and Matteo Venturelli.
